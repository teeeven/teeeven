## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven â€” a data analyst based in Los Angeles. I currently work in higher education at SCI-Arc, a school of architecture and design. I leverage tools like SQL, Power BI, and Python to empower teams with data-driven decision-making. My role blends the functions of a business intelligence developer and a data analyst to bring data narratives to life and to provide data as a resource for others.

I draw inspiration from architecture and design to craft solutions that are scalable, precise, and visually engaging. I value curiosity, exploration, and the balance between scale and detail.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Automating and optimizing data processes for student admissions and faculty allocation using Power BI and SQL.
- Developing a machine learning model to predict Admission Department KPIs.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Advanced machine learning techniques, focusing on predictive modeling and data engineering.
- Enhancing my skills to deploy scalable data solutionsâ€”Iâ€™ve recently used Python virtual environments to deploy a project.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- Using object-oriented programming principles to write cleaner, modular Python code!
- Learning more about cloud architecture and best practices for deploying machine learning models, particularly in AWS or Azure.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
- Anything related to SQL, Power BI, Python, or data strategies in higher education.
- The Los Angeles Lakers!
