## Hi!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Steven -- I am a Data Analyst in the Arts District of Los Angeles. I work in the domain of higher education at an institution called SCI-Arc. 

This GitHub contains projects that are heavily inspired by my professional work and my close proximity and appreciations to architecture.

My design philosophy is rooted in 5 guiding principles, and I strive to incorporate them through my work.

They are rather straightforward --

1.   ATOMICITY â€“ Each piece should do one thing well
2.   IDEMPOTENCY â€“ Repeated actions should yield consistent, stable results, no side effects
3.   COMPOSABILITY â€“ Solutions should be modular and reusable
4.   OBSERVABILITY â€“ Build transparency into every operation
5.   IMMUTABILITY â€“ Treat data as a resource to be understood, preserved, and carefully shaped

Through this framework I strive to create solutions that are accurate, insightful, scalable, and well-designed.

You can read a bit more here -- thank you for stopping by!
