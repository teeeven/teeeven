# Hi there, I’m Steven 👋

I’m a Data Analyst based in the Arts District of Los Angeles. My GitHub is a living archive of data systems and self-initiated projects which explore ideas of what I think should exist. All of these projects are guided by principles I hold close, this is very important to me as I find this helps me develop my own style for creating and problem solving. Thanks for stopping by -- I'll do my best to update and throw new things that I build as they arrive. 

## 🪵 Design Philosophy

My approach to data and design draws from architectural craft: I aim for slow-built, scalable, purposeful, thoughtful design. I follow five guiding principles:

1. **ATOMICITY** – Each piece should do one thing well  
2. **IDEMPOTENCY** – Repeated actions should yield consistent, stable results  
3. **COMPOSABILITY** – Solutions should be modular and reusable  
4. **OBSERVABILITY** – Build transparency into every operation  
5. **IMMUTABILITY** – Treat data as material to be understood, preserved, and carefully shaped  

Through this lens, I create data systems that are **accurate, scalable, and quietly elegant**.

## 🤖 On Using AI in My Work

I believe in transparency and thoughtful craft. Many of the ideas and solutions here were refined with the help of AI collaborators like **ChatGPT** and **Claude**—used for pair programming, architecture review, documentation polishing, and following best practices.

I often use these tools to help define the **smallest viable units of work**, acting as a second set of eyes to **decompose complex systems** into testable, atomic components. They also support a **test-driven development (TDD)** mindset—encouraging deliberate structure, validation-first thinking, and composable patterns.

These tools don’t replace the work—they **support it**. Every commit reflects my judgment, iteration, and care. I treat AI as part of my toolkit: as an apprentice in the studio, it is invited to shape—but never define—the final form.

This is what modern craftsmanship looks like to me: curious, collaborative, and open about the tools we use to build with care.
